                    <h2 id="bellpepper">Bell Peppers</h2>
                    <p >The natural sweetness of bell peppers makes them an obvious choice for introducing healthy veggies
                        into kids’ diets. They’re also versatile. Raw bell peppers taste great dipped in hummus, while
                        cooked ones will liven up a stir fry. If your kid has an aversion to a certain food color,
                        you’re in luck! These come in red, orange, green, or yellow.</p>

                <div class="second">
                    <h2 id="greenbeas">Green Beas</h2>
                    <p>Green beans are high in both Vitamin K and calcium, so they benefit bone growth and blood health. This makes
                        green beans one of the best vegetables for toddlers, whose bones grow incredibly fast. Kids who 
                        prefer crunchier textures can eat them raw, and those that like soft veggies can eat the canned variety.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="first">
                    <h2 id="carrots">Carrots</h2>
                    <p>There’s a good chance carrots are one of the few vegetables you don’t have trouble getting your kids to eat. 
                        Paired with hummus or a yogurt dip, they make for a delicious and agreeable snack. They also go nicely cooked into a
                        hearty stew. These tasty veggies are full of beta carotene, fiber, potassium, and antioxidants.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="second">
                    <h2 id="peas">Peas</h2>
                    <p>Despite being somewhat unsightly green balls, lots of kids love peas. The sweet flavor and soft texture make them easy to
                        stomach.If your kid prefers a crunch, you can leave them in the pods. Peas are great for growing minds, aiding in 
                        the development of brain cells and improving memory.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="first">
                    <h2 id="broccoli">Broccoli</h2>
                    <p>Broccoli is one of the best sources of fiber around. Lots of kids like steamed broccoli, but if finely chopped,
                        you can incorporate it into salads or sauces too. Raw broccoli also tastes good with a dip. This excellent veggie
                        strengthens immune systems, improves eyesight, and helps regulate bowel movements.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="second">
                    <h2 id="spinach">Spinach</h2>                            
                    <p>Start by using spinach as an undercover veggie, incorporating it into sweet treats like smoothies and popsicles.
                        (Its green color won’t be visible when mixed with fruits like blueberries and blackberries.) Once your child
                        becomes more comfortable with the dark green color and mild taste, start adding spinach to sandwiches, side
                        salads and veggie sautees.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="first">
                    <h2 id="cucumber">Cucumber</h2>
                    <p>Cucumbers have a very high water content, making their flavor more mild and palatable for kids. Whether cut into
                        spears or coins, eaten plain or dipped in hummus, cucumbers can be served up in a variety of ways. Leave the skin 
                        on for extra crunch and fiber in your little one’s snack.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="second">
                    <h2 id="celery">Celery</h2>
                    <p>Snack time can turn into craft time when you make ants on a log with your kids. With nut butter, dried fruit and 
                        celery sticks, your kids can make their own fun snack. Celery can also be dipped in hummus and Greek yogurt dips
                        alongside carrots and cucumbers.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="first">
                    <h2 id="mushroom">Mushrooms</h2>
                    <p>Whole mushrooms can be daunting for picky eaters due to their texture, but even picky eaters can learn to
                        appreciate their umami flavor. Pair chopped mushrooms with other vegetables and add them to a marinara sauce 
                        for a hearty, veggie-driven pasta. Mushrooms are a good way to add more vitamin D into your child’s diet, too.</p>

                <div class="second">
                    <h2 id="corn">Corn</h2>
                    <p>Sweet corn is one of the easier treats to get kids to eat due to its pleasant flavor. Grilling corn on the cob makes
                        for a fun snack to bite into, but it’s also easy to incorporate loose kernels into a salad or grilled veggie mixture.
                        High fiber content aids with digestion, and B vitamins contribute to overall developmental health.</p>

                <div class="first">
                    <h2 id="potatoes">Potatoes</h2>
                    <p>Every kid loves French fries, but be sure to feed them healthier versions of potatoes too. Leave the skin on for
                        extra nutrients. Eaten whole, these tasty favorites provide essential iron, protein, carbohydrates, and Vitamin C. 
                        Studies have shown they also help kids with sleeping disorders.</p>
