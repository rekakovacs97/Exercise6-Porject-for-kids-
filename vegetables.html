                <h2 id="bellpepper">Bell Peppers</h2>
                <p >The natural sweetness of bell peppers makes them an obvious choice for introducing healthy veggies
                    into kids’ diets. They’re also versatile. Raw bell peppers taste great dipped in hummus, while
                    cooked ones will liven up a stir fry. If your kid has an aversion to a certain food color,
                    you’re in luck! These come in red, orange, green, or yellow.</p>
                <h2 id="greenbeas">Green Beas</h2>
                <p>Green beans are high in both Vitamin K and calcium, so they benefit bone growth and blood health. This makes
                    green beans one of the best vegetables for toddlers, whose bones grow incredibly fast. Kids who 
                    prefer crunchier textures can eat them raw, and those that like soft veggies can eat the canned variety.</p>
                <h2 id="carrots">Carrots</h2>
                <p>There’s a good chance carrots are one of the few vegetables you don’t have trouble getting your kids to eat. 
                    Paired with hummus or a yogurt dip, they make for a delicious and agreeable snack. They also go nicely cooked into a
                     hearty stew. These tasty veggies are full of beta carotene, fiber, potassium, and antioxidants.</p>
                <h2 id="peas">Peas</h2>
                <p>Despite being somewhat unsightly green balls, lots of kids love peas. The sweet flavor and soft texture make them easy to
                     stomach.If your kid prefers a crunch, you can leave them in the pods. Peas are great for growing minds, aiding in 
                     the development of brain cells and improving memory.</p>
                <h2 id="broccoli">Broccoli</h2>
                <p>Broccoli is one of the best sources of fiber around. Lots of kids like steamed broccoli, but if finely chopped,
                     you can incorporate it into salads or sauces too. Raw broccoli also tastes good with a dip. This excellent veggie
                      strengthens immune systems, improves eyesight, and helps regulate bowel movements.</p>
