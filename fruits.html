                    <h2 id="berries">Berries</h2>
                    <p >They include strawberries, blueberries, cherries, and blackberries. The darker the colour 
                        pigment of the berry the more nutritious it is. Berries contain high levels of antioxidants, especially
                        vitamin C which can help prevent the risk of cancer. Berries are also good foods for brain. In 
                        a recent research, these fruits have been shown to support the cognitive functioning of rats,
                        and researchers also speculate a similar result in humans. They also hope that these fruits
                        may be important in preventing the unwanted long-term effects of stress on human brain function.
                        In addition, some studies have shown that berry extracts can help to improve memory function.
                        Berries’ seeds are also a rich source of omega-3 fats. If you want to boost your kids’ brainpower, 
                        buy more berries for snacking, or help your kids make their smoothies that they desire. You do not
                        need to trick them as kids love these fruits. Also, you can add some berries to your kids’ yogurt, 
                        dips, and hot or cold cereal. For a light dessert, add a mound of berries to a whipped topping. 
                        Otherwise, you also can add berries to vegetables that can boost the flavor. For example, you can
                        try sliced cherries with broccoli or strawberries with green beans.</p>

                    <h2 id="apples">Apples</h2>
                    <p>here are a lot of goodies this fruit contains to help your kids grow well. Firstly, pectin which is a dietary fiber
                        has some amazing properties. It can dissolve in water and also stimulate good bacteria to live in your kids’ gut 
                        and simultaneously, fight against any bad bacteria which try to live there. Secondly, a mineral called boron will
                        help your kids’ bone and teeth stay strong and healthy. As your children are in the most important years in a
                        child’s development, this mineral is very essential to them. Besides, apples are also rich in vitamin C. Just 
                        one apple can supply a quarter of your kids’ vitamin C requirements. Finally, apples help to protect you and 
                        your kids from diseases such as heart attacks, cancers, vision disorders, diabetes, and so on. It is fairly 
                        easy to include apples in your daily diet – you can add some apples as a light dessert after meals. Otherwise,
                        you also can have a cup of apple juice alone or in combination with other fruits going well with it such as 
                        carrots or oranges.</p>

                <div class="first">
                    <h2 id="bananas">Bananas</h2>
                    <p>Did you know that athletes eat lots of bananas because they are rich in carbohydrates that can help power 
                        muscles. Surely kids don’t need bananas to increase their muscle tone, however, kids do need the carbohydrates 
                        as a source of energy. This fruit is rich in vitamin B6 which is needed for a healthy skin, a nervous system 
                        and to produce the needed energy in the body. In addition to this, banana is also a rich source of dietary
                        fiber, vitamin C, and potassium which will help to keep your kids’ hearts strong and healthy. Surprisingly,
                        contrary to popular belief, bananas have no fat and it would be impossible to get fat on bananas so your kids
                        can enjoy these good fruits without any worries. In order to add more bananas to your kids’ diet, you can 
                        encourage them to eat a banana or to make some snacks such as banana cake or banana ice-cream.</p>

                <div class="second">
                    <h2 id="oranges">Oranges</h2>
                    <p>These fruits have been praised for their vitamin C content. Just one orange contains enough vitamin C for two days! Oranges are also a 
                        rich source of fiber, some beta carotene and many other carotenoids. Besides, the natural sweetness comes from a deal of glucose, 
                        fructose as well as sucrose. In addition to this, the pith and peel of oranges are a good source of pectin which is a kind of soluble 
                        fiber and flavonoids, which may be good at preventing colds. Due to great benefits of oranges, you should encourage your kids 
                        to drink a cup of freshly squeezed orange juice or simply eat some pieces of oranges every day. Also, a combination of orange 
                        and carrot is a good juice for kids which helps to boost the immune system.</p>

                <div class="first">
                    <h2 id="lemons">Lemons</h2>
                    <p>Similar to all citrus fruits, lemons are also an amazing source of vitamin C. 100ml of its juice will have 48mg of vitamin C, 
                        this is enough for a full day. Also, this fruit is rich in pectin, a kind of soluble dietary fiber which is used to set jams. 
                        According to some studies, soluble dietary fiber can help lower the levels of blood cholesterol. One thing you should keep in 
                        mind – it is important to rinse your kids’ mouth with water after eating lemons due to its high levels of acidity which can 
                        damage the tooth enamel. Do not brush the teeth immediately after eating them because the toothbrush is able to etch the acid 
                        into the tooth enamel.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="second">
                    <h2 id="peaches">Peaches</h2>                            
                    <p>These fruits are sweet with most of the natural sugar. They are a rich source of vitamin C and dietary fiber, 
                        and simultaneously provide small number of other vitamins and minerals, especially potassium. Besides, 
                        yellow-fleshed peaches contain beta carotene which the body will convert to vitamin A.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="first">
                    <h2 id="grapes">Grapes</h2>
                    <p>Their combination of sugars makes these fruits deliciously sweet. Their carbohydrates are digested slowly so the energy your 
                        kids get from grapes can last longer. Also, grapes are a rich source of dietary fiber, vitamin C and some other potassium. 
                        Grape skins have a plenty of antioxidants that are crucial for human health.</p>

                    <h2 id="pineapples">Pineapples</h2>
                    <p>Pineapples contain an enzyme (bromelain), which can tenderize meat if used as a marinade. Also, these fruits are a 
                        good source of dietary fiber, vitamin C, and the mineral called manganese which is necessary to human bones, the 
                        cartilage in joints and the brain.</p>

                    <h2 id="pears">Pears</h2>
                    <p>While these fruits’ skin color ranges from green to yellow to brown, the nutritional value of their white flesh is not 
                        different, but some are sweeter than the others as their natural sugar content may be higher. Pears contain a low GI. 
                        This means that the carbohydrate of pears will be digested slowly and gives you a longer source of energy. In addition 
                        to this, they also contain dietary fiber, vitamin C, some vitamin E and other minerals. Especially, pears are lower in 
                        potassium than most of other fruits and this is good for some kids who have to get a low- potassium diet due to particular 
                        kidney problems.</p>
